# Dice Probability Simulator

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Description
This project simulates rolling one or two dice multiple times and calculates the probability of each outcome.  
It demonstrates randomness, loops, arrays, and probability analysis in C++.

## Features
- Roll 1 or 2 dice  
- Track outcomes and counts  
- Calculate probabilities (%) for each outcome  
- Compare expected vs actual results  
- Input validation to ensure valid number of dice and rolls

## Skills Demonstrated
- Random number generation (`rand()`, `srand()`)  
- Loops and conditional statements  
- Arrays for data tracking  
- Probability and statistical analysis  
- Console-based input/output  

## How to Run
1. Open the project in a C++ IDE (Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or similar).  
2. Compile the program.  
3. Run the program and follow the console instructions:
   - Enter the number of dice (1 or 2).  
   - Enter the number of rolls.  
   - Review the outcome counts and probabilities.

## Example Output
Outcome   Count   Probability (%)
1         168     16.8%
2         145     14.5%
3         152     15.2%
